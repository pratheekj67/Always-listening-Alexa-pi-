just download the img file [uploaded] ALap.img and burn it to your raspberry pi using win32 diskimager
[link to download:https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/]
then after you have successfully burnt the image follow these instructions:-
1> connect your usb sound card with mic and speakers connected
